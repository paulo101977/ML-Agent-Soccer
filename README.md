AI Learns to Play Soccer (Deep Reinforcement Learning)
This project showcases an AI agent learning to play soccer using Deep Reinforcement Learning. The agent starts with no prior knowledge and gradually improves through trial and error, learning to head the ball, defend, and score goals.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
Simulation Environment: Unity with ML-Agents
Training Algorithm: Reinforcement Learning (PPO, A3C, or DDPG)
Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch
Key Features:
AI-controlled soccer players
Custom reward shaping for better decision-making
Training progression from random movement to structured gameplay
ðŸ›  How It Works
The agent starts without any understanding of soccer.
Through reinforcement learning, it receives rewards for beneficial actions (e.g., heading the ball forward, scoring goals) and penalties for mistakes (e.g., own goals).
Over multiple iterations, the AI refines its strategy, improving defense, positioning, and teamwork.
ðŸ“Œ Future Plans
This project is part of a series exploring AI in different tasks. Future experiments may include:
âœ… AI learning to park a car
âœ… AI mastering complex team-based games
âœ… Further improvements in soccer AI strategy
